## **Flask Application Design for Quantum Computing Problem**

## **HTML Files**

1. **index.html**:
   - Purpose: Serves as the main landing page of the application.
   - Content:
     - Introduction to the application and its purpose in tackling quantum computing problems.
     - Explanation of how users can interact with the application to input their quantum computing-related queries.
     - Option for users to navigate to the problem-solving section.

2. **solve.html**:
   - Purpose: Displays the problem-solving form to users.
   - Content:
     - Input fields for users to enter their specific problem parameters, such as quantum gate sequences, number of qubits, and desired output.
     - Option for users to choose a suitable quantum computing algorithm from a list of available algorithms.
     - Submit button to initiate the problem-solving process using the Flask server.

3. **results.html**:
   - Purpose: Displays the results of the problem-solving operation to users.
   - Content:
     - The output of the quantum computing algorithm, presenting the solution to the user's problem.
     - Visualization of the solution, if applicable, to aid in understanding.
     - Option to return to the main page or to the problem-solving form.

## **Routes**

1. **Home Route (/index)**:
   - Purpose: Directs users to the main landing page of the application, which is index.html.
   - Implementation:
     - Define a route decorator, such as `@app.route('/index')`, to associate the route with the corresponding view function.
     - The view function simply renders the index.html template.

2. **Solve Route (/solve)**:
   - Purpose: Handles the user's input for solving quantum computing problems and processes it using Flask server-side logic.
   - Implementation:
     - Define a route decorator, such as `@app.route('/solve', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`, allowing both GET and POST requests.
     - The view function retrieves user input data from the request object, e.g., using `request.form`.
     - The view function performs the necessary computations or calls external quantum computing APIs to solve the problem.
     - It then redirects the user to the results page (results.html) with the solution.

3. **Results Route (/results)**:
   - Purpose: Displays the results of the problem-solving operation to the user.
   - Implementation:
     - Define a route decorator, such as `@app.route('/results')`.
     - The view function renders the results.html template, providing the solution data to display to the user.

## **Additional Considerations**

- Incorporate a CSS file to style the HTML pages for a user-friendly appearance.
- Implement error handling in the routes to gracefully manage invalid user input or unexpected issues.
- Consider using a templating engine like Jinja2 to dynamically generate the HTML content based on data obtained from the Flask routes.
